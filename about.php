			<h2>THE CREATORS</h2>
			<img src="img/about.png"/>
			
			<p> At the fall of 2017 we got a task to concure the world of PHP and that's what we did. Never before, had anyone of us dared to take a step in this djungel of code but now we where more or less forced to face our fears and embrace this unknown land of problemsolving. Togheter, we've been facing long nights, errors and undefined indexes. We've been living at the edge of session hijacking and long sessions of cookie-eating but finally, we saw our rescue, Bar Locator. The key to life itself, the answer to all questions and the tool you always wanted. <br> All we can say is, you're welcome! </p>
